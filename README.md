# Learning Haskell
Started on Fub 13th.

This repository is used to put Haskell snipets and suites.
I will use only English so that I will be able to think in English easily.

## Daily goals
### Fub 13th
To be able to define funciton named ``is-prime`` which determines weather the given number is a prime number or not.
